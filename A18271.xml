            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT VVORSHIPFVL, and his ſingular benefactors, Sir <hi>Iohn Harington Knight, as alſo to the VVorſhipfull</hi> Iames Harington Eſquire, his brother: <hi>R.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Booke (Right Worſhipfulls) conteineth certain verie pleaſant, delightfull, and profitable Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: that is, when two things or moe then two, are ſo compared, reſembled, and conferred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they in ſome one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie ſeeme like: Wherein not onely ſundrie, and very many, moſt horrible and foule vices, and daungerous ſinnes of all ſorts, are ſo familiarly, and ſo plainly laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, ripped vp, and diſplayed in their kinds, and ſo pointed at with the finger of God, in his ſacred and holy Scriptures, to ſignifie his wrath and indignation belonging vnto them, that ſuch as are Chriſtians in deed, being ſeaſoned and indued with the ſpirit of grace, and hauing God before their eyes, will bee verie feareful, euen in loue that they beare to God, to pollute and defile, their hearts, their minds, their mouthes, or hands, with any ſuch forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things; as alſo many very notable vertues, with their due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
<pb facs="tcp:8366:3"/> ſo liuely, and truly expreſſed, according to the plaine meaning of the word of God: that the godly Reader, (being of a Chriſtian inclination) will be mightily inflamed with an earneſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and a loue vnto them. Ouer and beſides, it containeth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning, and plaine opening of many grounds and principles of Chriſtian Religion, ſo manifeſtly decyphered out, that euerie one (euen the very ſimpleſt and ignoranteſt Reader) may eaſily and plainely vnderſtand the true and right meaning thereof, as may bee for the increaſe of knowledge and godlineſſe, euen in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of men, and for their better vnderſtanding therein. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times that thing, which cannont bee perceiued or vnderſtood of Readers of Bookes, and hearers of Sermons, by a ſimple pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, may yet by a Similitude or plaine example; bee attained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. So that if any be deſirous to compare a thing from the leſſe to the greater: Similitudes will helpe him greatly in this behalfe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And that there is a neceſſarie and profitable vſe of Similies, we may eaſily gather, for that the holy Ghoſt hath ſo often vſed them, both in the old and new Teſtament, as amongſt many, theſe few quotations doo ſhew. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.6. <hi>&amp;c. &amp;</hi> 23.4, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9.8. <hi>&amp;c.

            <p>So that this worke, in my ſimple opinion, for the choyſe of the Argument, rarietie of the matter, &amp; profit of the circumſtance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth to be aduiſedly read, attentiuely conſidered, effectually ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, and perfectly digeſted, becauſe that it will breede and increaſe in all degrees, no ſmall skill in knowledge, wiſedome, and vertue. For I know no eſtate of men for whome this Booke is not neceſſarie; for Princes it is prettie, for Preachers profitable, for ſage Counſellours it is ſingular, meete for Magiſtrates, lawdable for Lawyers, a Iewell for Gentlemen, a ſtaffe to leane on for ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, good to further godlineſſe, and therefore apt and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all men.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:8366:3"/>
            <p>The Prophets of God were moued (as their writings do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly prooue) to fetch from plants, hearbes, and other naturall things, many right apt and fine Similitudes, and proper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, to adorne their Sermons, &amp; garniſh their ſpeeches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to make the ſame by ſuch familiar meanes the eaſier to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and the readier to be belieued.</p>
            <p>And although in euerie other kind of learning, humaine diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and Phyloſophie, there be many ſingular ornaments, and peculiar garniſhments, effectually to delight the minde, and to draw it by example, and imitation, to vertue and honeſtie; yet for the true and perfect attaining, and fuller bringing to paſſe of theſe things, there bee none of greater, nor yet of like force and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to thoſe that are vſed by the holy Prophets in their diuine wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and propheſies: So that to him that is any whit reaſonably ſeene, either in the workes of nature, or in heauenly contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it may eaſily appeare, how that their writings and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies are not barren, rude, ignorant, and vnartificiall; but profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, fruitfull, learned, and eloquent. For the holy Scripture being giuen by inſpiration from God, fully and ſufficiently inſtructeth the minde, and furniſheth the conſcience and ſoule, with moſt ſweet foode, &amp; wholſome nouriſhment. Which thing the writings both of the Prophets in the old Teſtament, and alſo of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts and Apoſtles in the new Teſtament, do plentifully declare.</p>
            <p>Now for that there be very fit Similitudes, borrowed from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kindes, and ſundrie naturall things, both in the olde and new Teſtament, diligently noted and found out, as well by ordinarie practiſe and courſe of life, as alſo by obſeruing of the nature, effect, and vertue of things. I haue thought good at this time to take ſome paines, and to beſtow ſome labour in this Booke to ſet down the ſame, with others, vnto the view and conſideration of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and ſtudious Reader: Whereby he may ſee what a rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of knowledge and wiſedome, there is laide vp in the holy Scriptures: which affoordeth vnto the induſtrious and painfull Chriſtian, ſtore enough of matter, both pleaſurable and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, delightfull, wholeſome, and comfortable. Neither is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a man to reape any the like benefit of plentiful knowledge,
<pb facs="tcp:8366:4"/> and ſtore of learning, nor to taſte ſuch plentie of neceſſarie foode, both for ſoule and conſcience, out of any workes written by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, Oratours, or Poets, as hee may out of the plentifull ſtorehouſe, and aye laſting fountaine of Diuinitie, and out of thoſe Books, which were indighted and penned by the holy Ghoſt, and written by heauenly inſpiration. So that whoſoeuer ſhall adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly conſider, and attentiuely diſcuſſe, the deepe miſteries &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found knowledge laide vp in the Scriptures, and therewithall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, what ſurpaſſing wiſedome lodged in their minds, which left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them ſuch diuine inſtructions and wholeſome documents, cannot chooſe but moſt plainely perceiue, by how many degrees, diuine learning, and ſacred ſtudies, doo incomperably ſurmount all prophane skill, and humane knowledge, and how farre things heauenly and eternall, doo excell things earthly and tranſitorie.</p>
            <p>That the holy Prophets were not onely moſt exactly ſeene in the peereleſſe skill of Diuinitie, but moſt exquiſitely alſo furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the entire knowledge of all things naturall: and not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of any kind of learning or diſcipline: may by the diſcourſe in this Booke bee ſufficiently prooued, and manifeſtly gathered, for that in their writings, they vſe many Similitudes, and make ſo many compariſons of things, fetched off, and from the very ſecrets and bowels of nature: as namely, from wilde and tame beaſtes, foules, wormes, creeping and ſwimming creatures; Hearbs, Trees, the Elements, fire, water, earth, ayre, riuers, brookes, welles, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternes, Seas, ſtars, pearles, ſtones, lightning, thunder, raine, deaw, heate, drowth, cold, winds, blaſts, haile, ſnow, froſt, yce, Corne, ſeede, ſalt, leuen, nets, ſnares, and likewiſe from the humours in a mans body, as bloud, milke, women in trauaile, in child birth, droſſe, Iron, Gold, Siluer, and innumerable other things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they learnedly beautifie their matter, and (as it were) brauely garniſh and decke out their termes, words, and ſentences, with tropes, and figuratiue phraſes, Metaphors, Tranſlations, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Compariſons, Collations, Examples, Shemes, and other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of ſpeech, giuing thereby vnto their matter, a certaine kind of liuely geſture, and ſo conſequently, attyring it with light, perſpicuitie, eaſineſſe, eſtimation, and dignitie, ſtirring vp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<pb facs="tcp:8366:4"/> mens drowſie minds, and awaking ſlouthfull, negligent, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſluggiſh and retchleſſe people, to the conſideration and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the truth; and to the following and imbracing of vertue and godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>Hereby as they doo labour to deterre and withdraw the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked from their wicked wayes, by laying downe before them Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, tending to ſuch purpoſe: So doo they no leſſe ſtirre them vp to vertue, to true happineſſe, to perfect felicitie, to ſound aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to the feare of God, and truſt in his mercie. Finally, they each way ſeeke to winne them to the knowledge of God, and of themſelues; and leaue no way vnattempted, to allure and bring them to the truth, and perfect bleſſedneſſe.</p>
            <p>And as touching the godly, which feare the Lord, and frame their liues accordingly, they ceaſe not to encourage, confirme, ſtrengthen, and eſtabliſh them in their vertuous doings; by earneſt exhortations to perſiſt in their well begunne exerciſe. They doo (as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paule</hi> alſo willeth) <hi>Admoniſh ſuch as walke inordinately;</hi> and liue out of courſe, being vntractable, and vnruly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.11. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.11.</note> to remember their dutie, &amp; to acknowledge their fault, they gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprooue them, and mildly ſeeke to recouer them: they comfort the weake, and cheare vp the mourneful; they ſtrengthen the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and broken hearted, they reuiue the ſorrowfull and heauie ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, they raiſe vp them that are throwne downe: they vſe lenitie, mildneſſe, and compaſſion towardes all men in generall: they are ſlow to anger, ſlow to reuenge and violence: they heale the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and bruſed conſciences, they preach deliuerance to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, ſight to the blind, libertie to the impriſoned, comfort to the afflicted, ioy to the diſtreſſed, health to the ſicke, recouerie to the diſeaſed; and to the miſerable releaſement from the thraldome and tyrannie of the Diuel: all theſe and many other, they notably, and elegantly, ſet forth in their writings, by moſt apt Parables, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Compariſons, and effectuous Similitudes.</p>
            <p>Chriſt in whome are hidden all the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.3</note> (ſaith the Euangeliſt) ſpake all theſe things to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by Parables, and without a Parable ſpake he nothing vnto them, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet,
<pb facs="tcp:8366:5"/> who ſaid: I will open my mouth in Parables, &amp;c. To the which <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his fourth Booke againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> dooth very fitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſaying: Neither is the forme of Chriſts ſpeech new, when he obiecteth Similitudes. Alſo <hi>Origen, cap.</hi> in <hi>Math.</hi> 13. writeth, that Chriſt ſpake nothing to the companies of common people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Parables (which are a kind of Similies) but to his Diſciples, to whom it was giuen to know the myſteries of the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, he did not ſo. Therefore a Similie is moſt fit for a Preacher, becauſe it reaſoneth from things confeſſed, and very manifeſtly, and wonderfully layeth the matter euen before the eyes. So that the vſe of a Similie reacheth very farre: for it is vſed for ornament, for delight, for plainneſſe, &amp; for grauitie. Nothing bringeth more grace, pleaſure or dignitie. Neither is it to bee couered in ſilence, that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> &amp; the auncient Church men, did commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne with a Similie agreeing to their argument.

For albeit that they be vnited together by perſonall vnion, yet for all they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine alway diſtinct in their vnitie, according to their properties, and not confuſed, in ſuch ſort, that the one cannot be the other: wherefore wee may not ſay at all, that the Diuinitie is the humanitie, or that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, is the Diuinitie, nor that the one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into the other. For if there were ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, they ſhould no more be that which they are, but ſhould bee chaunged into other natures, which thing cannot be. For God can neuer bee but God. Wherefore hee cannot be conuerted into man, but he may vnite man to himſelfe, as he hath done in the perſon of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. Likewiſe man cannot bee conuerted into God, for ſo much as he is a creature, and that God which is the Creator of all, cannot bee created, but is without beginning, as hee is without end and infinite: the which thing cannot agree with any creature. From whence it followeth, that the Gods which are created are no Gods at all, but are onely crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or elſe vaine illuſions or imaginations. And as the ſubſtance of GOD, cannot bee conuerted into that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8366:34"/> of man, nor that of man, into that of God: for otherwiſe, God ſhould not be God, nor man ſhould not be man at all: Euen ſo neither the one nor the other may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conuenient and naturall properties belonging to the diuine nature, it is no more diuine nature, but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. In like ſort, if the Sacramentall ſignes of the Body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, haue the naturall properties which do belong to the Bread and to the Wine, as they haue indeed; if they haue their qualities and accidents, and theſe ſame effects, they are not then really and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancially the Body and bloud of him, but Bread and Wine remaining alwaies in their ſubſtance with their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 As the bodie of the Sunne, and light of it, are ſo ioyntly ioyned together, that the one cannot be ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the other, yet it followeth not, that whereſoeuer the light of the Sunne is, there the body of the Sunne muſt be alſo. For as the Sunne being ſtill in the Element according to the order that God hath appointed among vs his creatures, doth wtth his light refreſh, comfort, and quicken all things here vpon earth. So our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus who is the true Sonne of righteouſneſſe, being ſtill (vntill the time that God hath appointed) on the right hand of his Father touching his manhood, that is to ſay, aboue in heauen in the place of beatitude, felicitie and ioy, raigning there with the Father in equall glorie and maieſtie, doth continually aſſiſt, aide and comfort his Church, by his holy ſpirit, being alwaies preſent with his elect and choſen, by his diuine Maieſtie, prouidence, and inuiſible grace, whom hee doth not ceaſe through his almightie power, the ſpirit being the worker of it, to feede ſtill with the wholſome foode of his moſt precious fleſh and bloud. Now as it were moſt noyſome and hurtfull
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8366:34"/> vnto all the whole earth, if we had here belowe the Body of the Sunne: ſo is it not expedient, that the Church and Congregation of the faithful, ſhould haue Chriſt ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent here, touching his humanitie and manhood.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 As no man can denie but that the eye and the ſight of it, be ſo ioyntly and inſeperably ioyned together, that as long as the eye is whole and ſound, the one cannot be ſeperated from the other: yet the eye is not in all places that the ſight dooth reach vnto. As wee knowe that ſeueritie and mercie are in God ſo ioyntly ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the one cannot be ſeperated from the other, and yet they that feele his ſeueritie, doo not feele his mercie: that is to ſay, thoſe whom he doth according to his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous iudgement puniſh euerlaſtingly in hell fire, them doth he vtterly baniſh and put away from his bounteous goodneſſe and mercie.
